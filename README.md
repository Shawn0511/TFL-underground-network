# TFL-underground-network
Exploring and Modelling Passenger Flow in the London Underground Network

This repository analyses nine years of Transport for London (TFL) datasets to show where and when crowding happens and to train a model that flags potentially overcrowded origin–destination (OD) links.

---

## 🔍 Key questions answered

1. **How has crowding on rail links evolved pre-COVID-19 and post-COVID-19?**  
2. **Which OD links and stations are persistently crowded?**  
3. **can we predict which origin–destination (OD) links will be critically crowded in the near term?**

The time series plot of daily total entry and exit tap counts across the entire network from 2019 to 2025 is shown below, It reflects that a sharp drop in demand occurs in early 2020, corresponding to the COVID-19 lockdowns. A gradual recovery is observed from late 2020 to 2023. For the period of Post-2022, the ridership level seems to plateau but does not yet fully reach pre-pandemic levels.
